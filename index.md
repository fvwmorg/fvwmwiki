# Welcome to the FvwmWiki

This is the home of the FvwmWiki, a collection of user pages, tips, etc.,
focusing on [Fvwm](http://www.fvwm.org).
Fvwm is a very flexible and configurable [window manager](
{{ "/WindowManager" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
Here are some [testimonials]({{ "/Testimonials" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
from Fvwm users.

If you are new to Fvwm,
[Read me]({{ "/NewToFvwm" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) first.

## About the Wiki

This wiki has migrated a few times and grown as it gets updated
each time. Currently the wiki is generated by [Jekyll](
https://jekyllrb.com/), which is what is used to generate static
pages on <https://github.com>.

A copy of the code to generate the wiki can be found at
<https://github.com/somiaj/fvwmwiki>.

A [/Todo]({{ "/Todo" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) list of the pages
that need to be updated/created to complete this migration to Jekyll.
