# FvwmWiki Todo List

The source for the wiki can be found at
<https://github.com/somiaj/fvwmwiki>.

The wiki is written mostly in [Markdown](
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet),
and built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Information about the layout, building and syntax highlighting
used in the wiki can be found on the github page.

This is a list of things that are still left unfinished.

## Edits and Cleanup

+ There is still some mention of configuration syntax for 2.4.x and 2.5.x in the
  older pages. Update syntax and versions to 2.6.x. Older syntax should be removed
  or left has a historical note.

+ There are still artifacts left in older pages from importing them from the
  previous wiki format.

## Blank Pages

These are pages that are places holders.

+ [/DefaultConfig](/wiki/DefaultConfig) -- Currently just a copy of the config file.
  Intended to give an overview of how the config works in terms of bindings, menu ops, etc.
+ [/Config/Conditionals](/wiki/Config/Conditionals) -- Intended to be a guide into how
  to use conditional statements, both in the config and in complex functions.
+ [/Config/Modules](/wiki/Config/Modules) -- Intended to describe module alias
  configuration syntax, \*Foo, and how to configure, start and stop them.
  Then point at [/Modules](/wiki/Modules) for specifics for each module.

## Updates

Pages that need to be updated

+ [/NewToFvwm](/wiki/NewToFvwm) -- Idea: include a description of the default config
  and maybe point to some of the pages that would be useful to someone starting
  with the default config and editing it.
+ [/WindowManager](/wiki/WindowManager)
+ [/Modules/\*](/wiki/Modules) -- Most the modules don't have much more than a
  description. These need to all be updated and include some examples of different
  pannels and things that can be done with modules.
